        <p class = "ingredient"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Put the mushrooms into a food processor with some seasoning and pulse to a rough paste. Scrape the paste into a pan and cook over a high heat for about 10 mins, tossing frequently, to cook out the moisture from the mushrooms. Spread out on a plate to cool.
</p>
        <p class = "ingredient"><strong>Step 2:</strong>Heat in a frying pan and add a little olive oil. Season the beef and sear in the hot pan for 30 secs only on each side. (You don’t want to cook it at this stage, just colour it). Remove the beef from the pan and leave to cool, then brush all over with the mustard.</p>
        <p class = "ingredient"><strong>Step 3:</strong>Lay a sheet of cling film on a work surface and arrange the Parma ham slices on it, in slightly overlapping rows. With a palette knife, spread the mushroom paste over the ham, then place the seared beef fillet in the middle. Keeping a tight hold of the cling film from the edge, neatly roll the Parma ham and mushrooms around the beef to form a tight barrel shape. Twist the ends of the cling film to secure. Chill for 15-20 mins to allow the beef to set and keep its shape..</p>
         <p class = "ingredient"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Roll out the puff pastry on a floured surface to a large rectangle, the thickness of a £1 coin. Remove the cling film from the beef, then lay in the centre. Brush the surrounding pastry with egg yolk. Fold the ends over, the wrap the pastry around the beef, cutting off any excess. Turn over, so the seam is underneath, and place on a baking sheet. Brush over all the pastry with egg and chill for about 15 mins to let the pastry rest.

    <p class = "ingredient"><strong>Step 1: </strong>To make this chicken curry recipe, place the chicken in a bowl with the garlic, ginger, salt, chilli powder and lemon juice. Mix, cover with cling film and chill for 30 mins.

Mix together the yogurt, garam masala, turmeric and cumin and add to the chicken, making sure that each piece is well coated with the mixture. Cover again and chill for 3-4 hours.</p>
    <p class = "ingredient"><strong>Step 2: </strong>Preheat the oven to 180ºC/Fan 160ºC/gas mark 4. Put the marinated chicken pieces on a grill rack set on a baking tray and bake for 8-10 mins. Brush the chicken pieces with a little oil and turn them over. Bake for another 10-12 mins until just cooked through.</p>
    <p class = "ingredient"><strong>Step 3: </strong>For the sauce: Heat the ghee or butter in a pan and add the garlic and ginger. Fry for a min or so then add the cardamom, cloves, coriander, garam masala, turmeric and chilli powder. Stir well and fry for 1-2 mins until they give off a lovely aroma. Stir in the tomato pure and lemon juice and cook for another couple of mins. Add the chicken pieces to the sauce and stir well to coat. Finally, add the butter and cream and stir continuously until the butter has melted and the sauce is smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning.</p>
    <p class = "ingredient"><strong>Step 4: </strong>Transfer to a warm bowl and serve hot, garnished with chopped coriander.</p>

    <p class = "ingredient"><strong>Step 1:</strong>Pour both creams into a medium saucepan. Lightly bash the mint sprigs with a wooden spoon to release their fragrance and add to the pan. Heat very gently for 5-6 minutes to infuse the cream with the mint.
Meanwhile, break up the chocolate and place in a heatproof bowl with the diced butter and honey.</p>
    <p class = "ingredient"><strong>Step 2:</strong>Strain the hot cream through a sieve onto the chocolate, butter and honey, stirring as you do so; discard the mint sprigs. Continue to stir until the chocolate has melted and the mixture is smooth.
Pour the mixture into a wide, shallow dish, cover and chill in the fridge for an hour or until firm.</p>
    <p class = "ingredient"><strong>Step 3:</strong>Scatter your chosen coating(s) on separate plates. Take the truffle mix from the fridge and, using a teaspoon, scoop out a portion and shape into a sphere by quickly rolling it in your hands. (Do this speedily to avoid the truffle melting with the warmth of your hands.) Toss the truffle in your preferred coating and arrange on a plate. Repeat with the rest.</p>
    <p class = "ingredient"><strong>Step 4:</strong>Place the truffles in a shallow plastic container, seal and refrigerate until firm and ready to serve. Eat within 3–4 days.</p>
